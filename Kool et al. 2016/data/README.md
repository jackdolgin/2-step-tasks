#Data
These directories contain all the raw data for both two-step paradigms, and the functions that are used to analyze them.

The functions that fit the data to the RL models (mfit_wrapper.m) will take a long time to finish. This process can be sped up by breaking up these analyses and running them in parallel jobs on your institution's computing cluster.
